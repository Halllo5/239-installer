# 239 Installer

239 Installer is a collection of simple scripts to install a wordpress site following the guidelines of [239 Module](https://bbz.macherit.ch/m239_main/).

**FTP is not working at the moment**.

To do this, you can simply clone the git repository and run `installer239.sh`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Halllo5/239-installer.git


cd 239-installer

chmod 777 installer239.sh


./installer239.sh
```

#### This is not a complete script, but I will try to improve things so that at least the available functions work
